# IBM Data Science Capstone – SpaceX Project

This repository contains my work for the **IBM Data Science Capstone Project**, where the main objective is to analyze SpaceX launch data and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a successful Falcon 9 first stage landing.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **lab01** → Data collection using the SpaceX API  
- **lab02** → Data collection through web scraping (Wikipedia)  
- **lab03 – SQL notebook** → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL queries  
- **lab04 – EDA** → Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Wrangling  
- **lab05** → Interactive maps with Folium  
- **lab08** → Predictive analysis and machine learning models  

## 🛰️ Project Objectives

- Collect SpaceX launch data via API and Wikipedia scraping  
- Perform data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze launch outcomes using SQL and data visualizations  
- Build interactive maps to explore launch sites and landing outcomes  
- Develop machine learning models to predict landing success  
- Achieve ~83% accuracy in predicting Falcon 9 first stage landings  

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Folium, BeautifulSoup  
- **Database:** DB2 SQL  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks  

## 📊 Key Findings

- Data was collected from both the SpaceX API and Wikipedia.  
- Landing outcomes were labeled into successful and unsuccessful classes.  
- Exploratory analysis showed improved landing success rates after 2013.  
- SQL queries helped identify trends in payloads, launch sites, and mission outcomes.  
- Interactive maps revealed the geographic distribution of launches in the U.S.  
- Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM) achieved an average accuracy of **83%**.  

## 🚀 Business Value

Predicting successful landings can save SpaceX (and competitors like “SpaceY”) around **$100 million USD per launch** by enabling booster reuse.
